# Separate Question Papers Website Plan

## Objective

Split the current mixed product into two sites inside the same repo:

- `sppucodes/` for codes only
- `sppuquestionpapershub/` for question papers only

The goal is not just code movement. The goal is to make:

- the codes site fully code-focused
- the question papers site fully question-paper-focused
- URLs simpler
- data ownership cleaner
- internal links less confusing

---

## Target End State

## Website 1: `sppucodes`

Purpose:

- serve subject code pages
- serve question-level code pages
- serve API/raw answer files if you want to keep them here

Primary routes:

- `/`
- `/<subject_code>`
- `/<subject_code>/<question_id>`
- `/submit`
- `/contact`
- `/api/...` for code-related APIs only

Question paper behavior:

- homepage button redirects to new question papers site
- subject pages link out to the matching subject page on the new site
- no local `/question-papers`
- no local question-paper viewer
- no local question-paper list API

## Website 2: `sppuquestionpapershub`

Purpose:

- serve only question papers
- make question-paper discovery and subject pages the core product

Primary routes:

- `/` instead of current `/question-papers`
- `/<subject>` instead of current `/question-papers/<subject>`

Optional future routes:

- `/branch/<branch>`
- `/semester/<semester>`
- `/search`
- `/sitemap`

---

## New URL Structure

## Current

- `/question-papers`
- `/question-papers/<subject>`

## New

- `/`
- `/<subject>`

## Mapping rule

- old: `https://sppucodes.vercel.app/question-papers`
- new: `https://your-question-paper-domain/`

- old: `https://sppucodes.vercel.app/question-papers/<subject>`
- new: `https://your-question-paper-domain/<subject>`

Examples:

- `/question-papers/database-management-systems-cse` -> `/database-management-systems-cse`
- `/question-papers/artificial-intelligence-aids` -> `/artificial-intelligence-aids`

---

## Recommended Repo Structure

## Current repo root

Keep one repo, but split apps cleanly.

Suggested structure:

- `sppucodes/`
- `sppuquestionpapershub/`
- `shared/` optional, only if you later want shared helpers/data scripts

Suggested app-local structure:

- `sppucodes/app.py`
- `sppucodes/src/...`
- `sppucodes/templates/...`
- `sppucodes/static/...`
- `sppucodes/questions/...`
- `sppucodes/answers/...`
- `sppucodes/vercel.json`

- `sppuquestionpapershub/app.py`
- `sppuquestionpapershub/src/...`
- `sppuquestionpapershub/templates/...`
- `sppuquestionpapershub/static/...`
- `sppuquestionpapershub/question-papers/...`
- `sppuquestionpapershub/vercel.json`

Optional shared root files:

- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`
- root workspace notes

---

## What Belongs in the New Question Papers Site

These are the question-paper-specific pieces found in the current codebase.

## Data

Move:

- `question-papers/question-papers-r2/*.json`
- `question-papers/question-papers-supabase/*.json`
- `question-papers/pyqs-seo/*.json`

Maybe keep or move depending on workflow:

- `static/pyqs/upload.py`
- `static/pyqs/validator.py`
- `static/pyqs/rename.py`
- `static/pyqs/comparison_report.txt`

These are operationally question-paper tooling, so they belong with the new site.

## Backend logic

Move:

- `src/routes/question_papers.py`
- question-paper parts of `src/utils.py`
  - `_extract_semesters_from_data`
  - `_load_seo_index`
  - `load_question_papers`
- question-paper config from `src/config.py`
  - `QUESTION_PAPERS_DIR`
  - `PDF_SOURCE`
  - `QP_PDF_DIR`
  - `QP_SEO_DIR`
  - `DEFAULT_EXAM_TYPE`

Move question-paper API endpoints from `src/routes/api.py`:

- `/api/question-papers/list`
- `/api/notify-download`
- `/api/pdf-proxy`

## Templates

Move:

- `templates/select.html`
- `templates/viewer.html`

Maybe recreate instead of directly moving:

- `templates/sitemap.html`

Reason:

- current sitemap mixes codes + question papers
- new site should have its own clean sitemap page

## Static assets

Move:

- `static/css/select.css`
- `static/css/viewer.css`
- `static/js/download-paper.js`
- `static/pdfjs/**`

Likely copy/shared:

- `static/js/analytics.js`
- `static/images/logo.png`
- `static/images/logo.webp`
- `static/images/favicon.ico`

If the new site gets its own branding, replace these rather than sharing forever.

---

## What Should Stay in `sppucodes`

## Data

Keep:

- `questions/*.json`
- `answers/**`

## Backend logic

Keep:

- `src/routes/subjects.py`
- `src/routes/main.py`
- code-related parts of `src/routes/api.py`
- `load_subject_data`
- answer loading helpers

## Templates

Keep:

- `templates/index.html`
- `templates/subject.html`
- `templates/submit.html`
- `templates/contact.html`
- `templates/error.html`

But update them so they no longer assume local question-paper routes exist.

---

## Changes Needed in `sppucodes`

## 1. Homepage question papers button

Current:

- homepage links to local `/questionpapers`

Change to:

- direct absolute link to new domain homepage

Examples:

- `https://sppuquestionpapershub.vercel.app/`
- your custom domain if you set one later

Also update:

- desktop nav button
- mobile nav button
- any footer/sitewide mentions

## 2. Subject JSON `question_paper_url`

Current:

- `questions/*.json` contain local `question_paper_url`
- many are outdated or incorrect

Change all of them to the new site:

- `https://new-domain/<subject>`

This needs to be updated for:

- `questions/ai.json`
- `questions/ann.json`
- `questions/cgl.json`
- `questions/cnl.json`
- `questions/cs.json`
- `questions/dbms.json`
- `questions/ds.json`
- `questions/dsal.json`
- `questions/dsl.json`
- `questions/iotl.json`
- `questions/nlp.json`
- `questions/oop.json`

## 3. Subject page button behavior

Current:

- `templates/subject.html` renders a `Question Papers` button from `question_paper_url`

Keep this behavior, but point it to the new domain.

## 4. Remove local question-paper routes

Remove from `sppucodes`:

- `src/routes/question_papers.py`
- registration of that blueprint in `src/__init__.py`
- local redirect logic for `/questionpapers` if no longer needed

Decision:

- either remove old paths fully
- or keep a thin redirect route that sends users to the new domain

Recommended:

- keep redirects for old public URLs for user continuity

## 5. Remove question-paper APIs from codes site

Remove or externalize:

- `/api/question-papers/list`
- `/api/notify-download`
- `/api/pdf-proxy`

Because after the split they belong to the question-paper site.

## 6. Clean homepage search behavior

Current `static/js/index.js` loads question papers into the mixed search experience.

Decide one of these:

- Option A: remove question papers from search completely
- Option B: keep them, but results open the new site

Recommended:

- remove them from `sppucodes` homepage search to keep site identity clean

## 7. Update error page

Current `templates/error.html` includes question-paper discovery and fetches `/api/question-papers/list`.

Change it so:

- `sppucodes` error page only shows code subjects
- optionally include one external button: `Go to Question Papers Site`

## 8. Update sitemap

Current sitemap includes question-paper URLs.

After split:

- remove all question-paper URLs from `sppucodes` sitemap
- keep only code-related pages here

---

## Changes Needed in `sppuquestionpapershub`

## 1. Homepage becomes current question-papers root

Map:

- old `templates/select.html` -> new homepage template

Need updates:

- canonical should be `/`
- titles/descriptions should reference the new brand
- links should point to `/<subject>`

## 2. Subject viewer page route changes

Map:

- old `/question-papers/<subject>` -> new `/<subject>`

Need updates in backend:

- route definition
- canonical
- OG URL
- breadcrumb schema
- back button behavior
- JS URL parsing in `download-paper.js`

Important:

`static/js/download-paper.js` currently assumes path contains `question-papers`.

That logic must be rewritten for the new root-level subject paths.

## 3. API route review

Keep:

- `/api/question-papers/list`
- `/api/notify-download`
- `/api/pdf-proxy`

But all URLs, metadata, and JS fetches should now belong to the new site.

## 4. Branding changes

Replace old `SPPU Codes` mentions in:

- titles
- descriptions
- schema
- visible body copy
- logo alt text
- footer/about sections

Current `viewer.html` repeatedly says `SPPU Codes`.

That must become the new site’s brand everywhere.

## 5. Sitemap and robots

New site should have:

- its own `robots.txt`
- its own `sitemap.xml`
- optional HTML sitemap

The new sitemap should include:

- `/`
- every `/<subject>`
- optional branch/semester pages if added

---

## Inventory of Current Code Touchpoints

These are the main places that will need edits or removal.

## `sppucodes` app side

- `templates/index.html`
- `templates/subject.html`
- `templates/error.html`
- `templates/sitemap.html`
- `static/js/index.js`
- `src/routes/api.py`
- `src/__init__.py`
- `src/config.py`
- `src/utils.py`
- `questions/*.json`
- `vercel.json`
- `robots.txt`
- `sitemap.xml`

## `sppuquestionpapershub` side

- `templates/select.html`
- `templates/viewer.html`
- `static/css/select.css`
- `static/css/viewer.css`
- `static/js/download-paper.js`
- `static/pdfjs/**`
- `src/routes/question_papers.py`
- question-paper parts of `src/utils.py`
- question-paper config in `src/config.py`
- question-paper endpoints in `src/routes/api.py`
- `question-papers/**`
- `vercel.json`
- `robots.txt`
- `sitemap.xml`

---

## URL Rewrite and Redirect Plan

## In old `sppucodes`

Recommended redirects:

- `/question-papers` -> `https://new-domain/`
- `/question-papers/<subject>` -> `https://new-domain/<subject>`
- `/questionpapers` -> `https://new-domain/`
- `/questionpapers/<subject>` -> `https://new-domain/<subject>`

This is important even if you said migration is not the main concern, because:

- existing users may have saved links
- some URLs may already be in Google
- internal stale links may exist for some time

## In new site

No extra prefix needed.

Keep it simple:

- homepage = discovery page
- subject page = root-level slug

---

## Data and Mapping Checklist

## Subject slug mapping

Before moving, confirm that every code subject’s `question_paper_url` points to the exact target slug on the new site.

Examples needing confirmation:

- `object-oriented-programming` vs `object-oriented-programming-aids`
- `database-management-system` vs `database-management-systems-cse` or `...-aids`
- `computer-networks` vs `computer-network-and-security-cse` or `computer-networks-aids`

This is important because current mappings are inconsistent.

## Branch ambiguity

Some code subjects may map to one branch-specific paper subject, but some may not be one-to-one.

You need a rule for each code page:

- if only one matching paper subject exists, link directly
- if multiple branch-specific paper subjects exist, decide:
  - pick one default branch
  - or link to a mini chooser page on the new site

This is one of the most important product decisions in the split.

---

## Practical Sequencing Plan

## Phase 1: Create the new app shell

- create `sppuquestionpapershub/`
- copy/move question-paper templates, routes, config, static assets, and data
- make homepage route `/`
- make subject route `/<subject>`

## Phase 2: Make the new site self-contained

- update branding
- update canonical/OG/schema URLs
- update `download-paper.js` path assumptions
- add new `robots.txt`
- add new `sitemap.xml`

## Phase 3: Disconnect question papers from `sppucodes`

- remove question-paper route blueprint
- remove question-paper APIs
- remove question-paper search integration
- remove question-paper section from `sitemap.xml`
- update homepage button to new domain
- update error page to stop calling question-paper APIs

## Phase 4: Rewire code subject links

- fix every `question_paper_url` in `questions/*.json`
- verify button behavior on all subject pages

## Phase 5: Clean deployment setup

- create separate Vercel project for `sppucodes/`
- create separate Vercel project for `sppuquestionpapershub/`
- set correct root directories
- give each app its own `vercel.json`

---

## New Site SEO Checklist

## Homepage `/`

- unique title
- unique meta description
- canonical to `/`
- visible HTML links to all subject pages
- branch/semester grouping
- not JS-only navigation

## Subject pages `/<subject>`

- unique title
- unique meta description
- canonical to self
- visible HTML list of available papers
- paper years in body text
- branch and semester in body text
- back links to homepage and related subjects

## Technical

- own sitemap
- own robots
- no mixed `SPPU Codes` branding
- no references to old `/question-papers/...` route

---

## Codes Site Cleanup Checklist

- remove local question-paper routes
- remove local question-paper templates
- remove question-paper APIs
- remove question-paper search results from homepage
- remove question-paper URLs from sitemap
- change nav/homepage question papers button to external new site
- update all `question_paper_url` fields
- update error page to not fetch question-paper data

---

## Question Papers Site Build Checklist

- create app folder
- move question-paper data JSONs
- move viewer/select templates
- move viewer/select CSS
- move `download-paper.js`
- move `pdfjs` assets
- move question-paper route code
- move question-paper utility loaders
- move question-paper API endpoints
- update route structure from `/question-papers/<subject>` to `/<subject>`
- update JS path parsing
- update all canonicals/schema/OG URLs
- add branding
- add sitemap/robots

---

## Risks to Watch

## 1. Broken subject-to-paper mapping

Current mappings are already inconsistent.

If not cleaned first, the split will preserve confusion.

## 2. Hidden route assumptions in JS

`download-paper.js` definitely assumes `/question-papers/<subject>`.

There may be a few more assumptions in templates and button handlers.

## 3. Shared config contamination

If both apps continue sharing one config module, it will get messy fast.

Prefer app-local config for each site.

## 4. Mixed branding leftovers

The new question-paper site should not keep saying `SPPU Codes` in schema, titles, and footer copy.

---

## Recommended Decision Rules

## Keep in `sppucodes` only if it serves code users directly

Keep:

- code answers
- code APIs
- subject pages

Move out if it exists only for question papers:

- viewer UI
- paper list APIs
- paper analytics
- paper JSON stores
- paper sitemap entries

---

## Final Recommendation

Treat this as a full product separation, not just a folder move.

The cleanest result is:

- `sppucodes` becomes lean and code-focused
- `sppuquestionpapershub` becomes the question-paper authority
- URLs become simpler on the new site
- internal linking becomes less confusing
- data ownership becomes much easier to reason about

If you execute this cleanly, the split can improve both maintainability and topical clarity.
